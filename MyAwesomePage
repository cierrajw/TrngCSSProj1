<h1>My Awesome Page</h1>
<p>
This is my awesome page, and on my awesome page I'd like to talk about my passion for doing fun things out in nature!
</p>
<p>
Hiking is definitely my favorite thing to do outdoors. One of the main reasons I moved to Colorado was for the glorious mountains and hiking adventures!

Here I'm at Sprague Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park.

And here, I'm at the magnificent Seven Falls with my mother!

I love to travel to far away places and explore nature too. Here I am zip lining in the jungles of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

Sometimes, a nature adventure is right in your backyard, like this photo where I'm standing on a fallen tree at Claude Moore Park in Sterling, VA:
